# Linked-lists

## Linked Lists Definition

- Linked List are linear data structures where every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. 
- Each object is called a Node. 
- The nodes are not stored in contiguous locations. They are linked using addresses.
- In a linkedlist we can create as many nodes as we want according to our requirement. This can be done at the runtime. 
- The memory allocation done by the JVM at runtime is known as DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION. 
- Thus, linked list uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory to the nodes at the runtime.
