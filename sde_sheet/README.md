### Intersection of Two Linked Lists

#### Brute Force approach

- Check for every node in second LL to check each node in first LL for equality
- When you found equal nodes return it, else you will reach the end hence return null
- Time Complexity: O(m * n); where m and n are length of LL 1 & 2 respectively

#### Better approach - Hashing

- Traverse through first LL and hash the **Node Address**
- Again traverse for second LL and check for equality
- When you found equal node address from HashMap return it, else you will reach the end hence return null
- Time Complexity: O(m + n); where m and n are length of LL 1 & 2 respectively
- Space Complexity: O(m); where m and n are length of LL 1 & 2 respectively

#### Optimal approach I - ( Lengthier approach )

- Take dummy nodes at head of both LL, and keep a count to store length of both the LL
- Take dummy nodes at head of both LL again, and cover the difference one LL using lengths
- Then, traverse simultaneously both the nodes to reach an intersection point
- When you found equal nodes return it, else you will reach the end hence return null
- Time Complexity = O(m) <= O(2m) <= { O(m) + O(m-n) + O(n) }; where m is length of longer LL and n is length of shorter LL

#### Optimal approach II - ( Concise approach )

- Take two dummy nodes d1 and d2, assign them to head of the LL
- Move d1 and d2 simultaneously till one of them reaches null
- Now, reassign that dummy node that is at null to the head of the other LL
- Repeat the same process for both nodes until them meet at intersection
- When you found equal nodes return it, else you will reach the end hence return null


##### Intuition behind Optimal approach II

- The first iteration is to find the difference directly and reassigning them to equate the difference
- Hence in the second iteration they either meet at intersection if exists or null
- This approach is similar Optimal approach I, but instead of calculating difference, here we directly find it with our logic
- Time Complexity: O(2m); where m is the length of longer LL
